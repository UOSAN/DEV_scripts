#what would it look like to take each whole-brain series, and align it to the moment of the tone?
#then we would have to have a series of images associated with each trial, and a set of metadata capturing the trials those images related to
#then we could produce maps of the max and min activity; but we still wouldn't be able to threshold it like an SPM

#another option:
#create a new event-based design matrix, where each event is a tone, and we capture events precisely aligned with tones
#nothing we have no does that.
