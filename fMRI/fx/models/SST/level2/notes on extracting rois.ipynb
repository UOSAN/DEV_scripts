    "   1. open a surface file from the anat directory. you can use inflated, midthickness, or other files. Be sure to select the `surf.gii` file type.\n",
    "   2. Next, open the brain dat from the `func` directory. You can NOT open the left and right brain data at the same time. Open one and then the other. Pick the `fs_native` images.\n",
    "   3. Hmmm--the problem with these images is that they are raw timeseries images; for our purposes here, we need ROIs extracted for the conditions; we need transforms associated with the conditions. Theoretically you could extract an SPM transform and simply apply it to an ROI extracted from the image but that seems quite complicated.\n",
    "   4. Label files are in `sourcedata/freesurfer/sub*/label/*`. However, these are not inteh format that CW expects, so I'm not sure how to read them. I'm sure we could figure it out; however, at this point, it's not worth it considering we need the condition contrast images.\n",

    "   - You can create an ROI from within MarsBaR, using the MarsBaR ROI definition options.\n",
    "   - You can also use a predefined ROI. MarsBaR supports various formats such as the Analyze format or MarsBaR ROI files.\n",
