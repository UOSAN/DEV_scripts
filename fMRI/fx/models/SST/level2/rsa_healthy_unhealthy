# analysis 1:
#Take the  interaction image we already have, and rather htan calculating its similarity to CS images across all subjects,
#calculate its similarity to the CS image from the same subject
#we'll get one similarity score per subject.
#then, compare the similarity score sample means for each group




# analysis 2
#Decompose the interaction image we have into:
#(W1|W2)*(Healthy|Unhealthy)
#that's 4 images
#then, calculate the similarity of each of those images to the CS image from the same subject
#we'll get 4 similarity scores per subject.
#the most straightforward analsyis then is to measure change over time
#but we could also do a linear model or mixed effects model
