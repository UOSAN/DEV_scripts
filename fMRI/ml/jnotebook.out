For MacOS or Linux, use this command to create SSH tunnel:

    ssh -N -L localhost:60605:n137:16330 bsmith16@talapas-ln2.uoregon.edu

Or try this if that doesn't work:

    ssh -N -L localhost:60605:n137:16330 bsmith16@talapas-ln2.uoregon.edu

For Windows/MobaXterm, use this info:

    Forwarded port: 60605
    Remote server: n137
    Remote port: 16330
    SSH server: talapas-ln2.uoregon.edu
    SSH login: bsmith16
    SSH port: 22

Then use this URL to access Jupyter (NOT the one in the log below):

    http://localhost:60605
